</ul>
<p>Most stealth-based games in the current industry make use of an AI that seems to be all-knowing.<br>For example; I&apos;m sure you ever came across the situation where you were sneaking around the enemies&apos; base gathering intel,<br>until suddenly a guard came across you. You tried to get away, but the AI seamingly seemed to know your every move, making it rather impossible to get away.</p>
<p>That&apos;s what this algorithm is trying to avoid, while still creating a thrilling chase sequence.</p>
<p>This is created using a variant of the Influence map algorithm.<br>It&apos;s splits up the propagating influence between a positive influence your guard AI want&apos;s follow<br>and an influence one that blocks of the former one.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">As stated before, the algorithm consists of two influences: a positive influence and a &quot;blockade&quot; influence.</span><br><span style="font-size: 16px;">These then spread themselves over the map accordingly.&nbsp;</span><br><span style="font-size: 16px;">To achieve this result, the algorithm has to take a few steps.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>The first step is the actual perceiving of the player and getting it&apos;s information.</strong></p>
<p>The AI has to be able to see the player and get it&apos;s velocity before any other part of the algorithm can work.<br>When the player leaves the AI&apos;s FOV, the algorithm can start.<br>The last known player&apos;s position and velocity are stored for further use in the algorithm.</p>
