</ul>
<p>Most stealth-based games in the current industry make use of an AI that seems to be all-knowing.<br>For example; I&apos;m sure you ever came across the situation where you were sneaking around the enemies&apos; base gathering intel,<br>until suddenly a guard came across you. You tried to get away, but the AI seamingly seemed to know your every move, making it rather impossible to get away.</p>
<p>That&apos;s what this algorithm is trying to avoid, while still creating a thrilling chase sequence.</p>
<p>This is created using a variant of the Influence map algorithm.<br>It&apos;s splits up the propagating influence between a positive influence your guard AI want&apos;s follow<br>and an influence one that blocks of the former one.</p>

    <li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 24px;">Design</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">As stated before, the algorithm consists of two influences: a positive influence and a &quot;blockade&quot; influence.</span><br><span style="font-size: 16px;">The blockade influence is needed so that the positive influence won&apos;t spread behind the player&apos;s last known velocity-direction.</span><br><span style="font-size: 16px;">It normally wouldn&apos;t make sense for the player to run back towards the guard and if he does so, he would be caught anyways.</span><br><span style="font-size: 16px;">These then spread themselves over the map accordingly.&nbsp;</span><br><span style="font-size: 16px;">To achieve this result, the algorithm has to take a few steps.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>The first step is the actual perceiving of the player and getting it&apos;s information</strong></p>
<p>The AI has to be able to see the player and get it&apos;s velocity-direction before any other part of the algorithm can work.<br>When the player leaves the AI&apos;s FOV, the algorithm can start.<br>The last known player&apos;s position and velocity-direction are stored for further use in the algorithm.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>The second step is putting up the first blockade and setting the influence<br></strong></p>
<p>To setup the first couple of blockade-nodes, it will have to get the node the player was last seen on.<br>All the nodes that are connected to it and are behind the player&apos;s last known velocity-direction will turn into a blockade-node.<br>After setting up the blockade, the player&apos;s last known node will emit a positive influence.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>The third step is propagating the blockade and the influence</strong></p>
<p>The positive influence emits itself in a wave-like manner.<br>All the nodes connected to a node that&apos;s on the max influence amount<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and aren&apos;t part of the blockade-nodes, emit the max influence amount.<br>All other nodes decrease their influence by a constant value.</p>
<p>The blockade-nodes on the other hand spread themselves out like a virus.<br>Every node that&apos;s connected to a blockade-node and is behind the player&apos;s last known velocity-direction, also become a blockade-node.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>The last and fourth step is limiting your algorithm</strong></p>
<p>This is needed so that the algorithm doesn&apos;t run forever.<br>There are a few conditions that stop the algorithm, them being:</p>
<p><em>Reaching the maximum amount of positive nodes in a propagation step</em><br>This value controls how long the algorithm will run when it reaches an open space.<br>When the new set positive nodes exceeds the limit in a propagation step, the algorithm stops.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><em>Reaching the maximum amount of propagation steps</em><br>This value controls how long the algorithm will run for alltogether.<br>The algorithm remembers how many steps it has set since it&apos;s beginning.<br>When the current propagation steps exceeds the max amount, the algorithm stops.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><em>Having no more nodes to emit positive influence to left</em><br>When the algorithm reaches a point where it can&apos;t spread it&apos;s positive influence anymore, it stops.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><u><strong>Adding other settings</strong></u></p>
<p>It&apos;s also possible to add in more settings into your algorithm.<br>Some of the custom settings my version of the algorithm has are:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><em>Max Heat</em><br>This value controls what the maximum influence is that a node can be.<br>It controls how long the positive nodes will linger after being put to max influence.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><em>Propagation Interval</em><br>This value controls how long it will take before another propagation step gets taken.</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
    <li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 24px;">Result</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">The result of taking all the steps is an influence map that predicts where the player could have run off to,</span><br><span style="font-size: 16px;">after being perceived by the AI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">How the AI handles this data is totally up to the designer.</span><br><span style="font-size: 16px;">The AI could for example;&nbsp;follow the positive nodes towards the player,</span><br><span style="font-size: 16px;">it could throw an attack that envelops the area behind the player, ...</span><br><span style="font-size: 16px;">The possibilities are endless.</span></p>
<p>A thing the player could do to counter-act this behavior without getting caught, is simply hiding.<br>While the guard runs towards the area he thinks the player ran off to,<br>the player could be laughing his butt off watching the guard run past him while he&apos;s hiding behind a bush.</p>
<p>While allowing many fun experiences, the algorithm doesn&apos;t come without it&apos;s holes.</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-size: 24px;">Conclusion</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">In conclusion, this chasing algorithm is great for creating an enjoyable and relatively fair chasing sequence for the player in closed off areas.</span><br><span style="font-size: 16px;">And in my opinion, having</span> an AI that seemingly guesses where the player could&apos;ve ran off to is more in par with </p>
