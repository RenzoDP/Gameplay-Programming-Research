<p>Most stealth-based games in the current industry make use of an AI that seems to be all-knowing.<br>For example; I&apos;m sure you ever came across the situation where you were sneaking around the enemies&apos; base gathering intel,<br>until suddenly a guard came across you. You tried to get away, but the AI seamingly seemed to know your every move, making it rather impossible to get away.</p>
<p>That&apos;s what this algorithm is trying to avoid, while still creating a thrilling chase sequence.</p>
<p>This is created using a variant of the Influence map algorithm.<br>It&apos;s splits up the propagating influence between a positive influence your guard AI want&apos;s follow<br>and an influence one that blocks of the former one.</p>
