</ul>
<p>Most stealth-based games in the current industry make use of an AI that seems to be all-knowing.<br>For example; I&apos;m sure you ever came across the situation where you were sneaking around the enemies&apos; base gathering intel,<br>until suddenly a guard came across you. You tried to get away, but the AI seamingly seemed to know your every move, making it rather impossible to get away.</p>
<p>That&apos;s what this algorithm is trying to avoid, while still creating a thrilling chase sequence.</p>
<p>This is created using a variant of the Influence map algorithm.<br>It&apos;s splits up the propagating influence between a positive influence your guard AI want&apos;s follow<br>and an influence one that blocks of the former one.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">As stated before, the algorithm consists of two influences: a positive influence and a &quot;blockade&quot; influence.</span><br><span style="font-size: 16px;">The blockade influence is needed so that the positive influence won&apos;t spread behind the player&apos;s last known velocity-direction.</span><br><span style="font-size: 16px;">It normally wouldn&apos;t make sense for the player to run back towards the guard and if he does so, he would be caught anyways.</span><br><span style="font-size: 16px;">These then spread themselves over the map accordingly.&nbsp;</span><br><span style="font-size: 16px;">To achieve this result, the algorithm has to take a few steps.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>The first step is the actual perceiving of the player and getting it&apos;s information</strong></p>
<p>The AI has to be able to see the player and get it&apos;s velocity-direction before any other part of the algorithm can work.<br>When the player leaves the AI&apos;s FOV, the algorithm can start.<br>The last known player&apos;s position and velocity-direction are stored for further use in the algorithm.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>The second step is putting up the first blockade and setting the influence<br></strong></p>
<p>To setup the first couple of blockade-nodes, it will have to get the node the player was last seen on.<br>All the nodes that are connected to it and are behind the player&apos;s last known velocity-direction will turn into a blockade-node.<br>After setting up the blockade, the player&apos;s last known node will emit a positive influence.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>The third step is propagating the blockade and the influence</strong></p>
<p>The positive influence emits itself in a wave-like manner.<br>All the nodes connected to a node that&apos;s on the max influence amount<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and aren&apos;t part of the blockade-nodes, emit the max influence amount.<br>All other nodes decrease their influence by a constant value.</p>
<p>The blockade-nodes on the other hand spread themselves out like a virus.<br>Every node that&apos;s connected to a blockade-node and is behind the player&apos;s last known velocity-direction, also become a blockade-node.</p>
